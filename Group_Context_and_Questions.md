2. **Hypothesis testing** (formal, required)
3. **Predictive modeling** (can use advanced ML)

### Tool Freedom

- Any tool allowed (not restricted to R)
- Focus is on interpretation, not prediction accuracy

### Viva Details (Mid-Evaluation)

- Starts: Monday Feb 23, 2026 (during lab session time)

- Format: Questions asked randomly to any team member
- Assessment: Common group mark based on answers
- Questions cover: topic selection rationale, data availability, techniques planned
- No laptops needed - they won't check work, just ask questions

### If Using Black-Box Models

- Allowed but must interpret using:
  - Feature importance
  - LIME
  - SHAP
