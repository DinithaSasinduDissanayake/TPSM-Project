# Requirements

> Confirmed requirements from lecturer and module outline

## Deliverables

| Component | Weight | Format |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Mid-Evaluation | 30% | Viva (5-10 mins) |
| Final Presentation | 70% | Presentation (templates TBA) |

---

## Required Analysis

1. **Descriptive analytics** — understand data distributions
2. **Hypothesis testing** — formal statistical test (required)
3. **Predictive modeling** — can use advanced ML

---

## Focus of Analysis

> "Keep in your mind here in this particular analysis we mainly focus about not the prediction, but the interpretation. I'm not actually expecting you to build very accurate model for the prediction. We want to identify the interpretation part."
>
> — Mr. Samadhi Chathuranga Rathnayake
> Week 5 Mid-Evaluation Briefing

**Key point:** Interpretation > Prediction accuracy

- Topic selection rationale
- Data availability and source
- Techniques planning to use

---

## Final Presentation

- Templates to be announced
- 70% of total marks
- Presentation format

---

## Tool Freedom

Any tool allowed (not restricted to R).

> "I don't restrict you to use the R. You can go with any analysis tool but I recommend you to use the R. R is having the most powerful statistical repositories."
>
> — Mr. Samadhi Chathuranga Rathnayake
> Week 1 Assignment Briefing

**Lecturer's recommendation:** Use R for statistical analysis.

**Why R?**
- Most powerful statistical repositories
- Easy to use for hypothesis testing
- Built-in datasets for ML (MASS, mlbench)
- Final exam will use R for hypothesis testing

## If Using Black-Box Models

> "If you go with some kind of a black box models like support vector machine or neural network, you can go with those advanced models as well, but then you have to interpret it. You can go with some explainable AI techniques like feature importance mechanism, LIME technique and SHAP technique."
>
> — Mr. Samadhi Chathuranga Rathnayake
> Week 5 Mid-Evaluation Briefing

Allowed, but must interpret using:
- Feature importance
- LIME
- SHAP

---

## AI Tools Policy

> "AI tools may be used only for the purpose of understanding or defining things. I'm not allowing you to use AI for data analysis, statistical modeling, code generation, and report writing."
>
> — Mr. Samadhi Chathuranga Rathnayake
> Week 1 Assignment Briefing

**Allowed:** Understanding concepts, defining problems, brainstorming
**Not allowed:** Data analysis, statistical modeling, code generation, report writing
