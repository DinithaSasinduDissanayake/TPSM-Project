# TPSM Project - Questions & Answers

## Resolved Questions

### Q1: What is expected for the project?
**Answer:** Justify whether the selected statement is correct or wrong using:
- Descriptive analytics
- Hypothesis testing
- Predictive modeling (can use advanced ML)

### Q2: Do we definitely need formal hypothesis testing?
**Answer:** YES, hypothesis testing is required.

### Q3: Are we restricted to a specific tool (e.g., R)?
**Answer:** NO - any tool is allowed. Lecturer wants to see how you reach your conclusion.

### Q4: What is expected for mid-evaluation / progress review (30%)?
**Answer:** 
- Viva format (5-10 minutes)
- NO report, NO presentation needed for mid-evaluation
- Questions will be about:
  - What topic selected and why
  - Data availability and source
  - Techniques planning to use
- Questions asked randomly to any team member
- Common group mark given based on answers
- Viva starts Monday Feb 23 onwards during lab session time
- Don't bring laptops - they won't check your work, just ask questions

### Q5: What if we use black-box models (neural networks, SVM)?
**Answer:** 
- Allowed, but must interpret them
- Use explainable AI techniques:
  - Feature importance
  - LIME
  - SHAP

---

### Q6: Is the focus on prediction accuracy or interpretation?
**Answer:** INTERPRETATION is the key focus, not prediction accuracy. Lecturer expects to see insights and how you prove the statement.

### Q7: What models/techniques will be taught in the module?
**Answer:**
- Linear regression
- Naive Bayes (classification)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Regularization techniques

### Q8: Will there be labs in the next 2 weeks?
**Answer:** NO regular labs - only viva slots. There will be one online common lab session to cover R programming for hypothesis testing.

### Q9: What about final exam format?
**Answer:** 
- Computer-based
- R programming for hypothesis testing implementation
- No manual calculations required
- Calculator allowed

## Open Questions (Unresolved)

### Q1: Should we use 1 dataset or multiple datasets?
From personal chat with Sandun (21/02/2026):
- Dinitha raised concern about whether to add another dataset
- Sandun plans to contact lecturer for clarification

**Status:** Pending - Sandun to ask lecturer

---

### Q2: Which learning objectives must be used?
From module outline, learning objectives include:
- Hypothesis testing
- Probability distributions
- Regression methods
- Exponential distributions
- Time series techniques
- Bayesian methods

**Uncertainty:** Which of these MUST be incorporated into the project?

---

### Q3: What does "collect primary or secondary data" mean in practice?
From `Assessments.pdf`: Must collect primary or secondary data relevant to the selected statement.

**Uncertainty:** What constitutes acceptable data collection for this specific topic about ensemble models?

---

### Q3: Is this H0/H1 formulation appropriate?
- H0: Ensemble models do not improve performance
- H1: Ensemble models improve performance

**Uncertainty:** Is this the correct way to frame the hypotheses for this topic?

---

### Q4: What if results are mixed?
Scenario: One experiment supports ensemble models, another favors non-ensemble models.

**Uncertainty:** Do we need more than 4 models before making a conclusion?

---

### Q5: When will report/presentation templates be shared?
Templates for final presentation (70%) were said to be shared within first week but not yet available.

**Uncertainty:** When will these be released?
